Terra is an open source Blockchain framework that is meant to be used by developers around the world. We need your help to make this website more friendly for developers of all languages.

If you can help translate the documentation here into another language, please go to Crowdin and pick a language to get started.

Once your translation gets approved, it will appear on this website!

If you are interested in approving translations from others, please send an email to core@terra.money.
